# Analysis-of-Active-Video-Games-Sedentary-Habits-in-Children

### Project Description
The project investigates the impact of autonomy in game choice on the physical activity levels of children through Active Video Games (AVGs). It explores how the choice influences engagement in AVGs, aiming to determine if autonomy could be a significant motivator for increasing physical activity among children and potentially counteracting the sedentary lifestyle encouraged by traditional screen time.

### Tools Used
* R: Utilized for cleaning and preprocessing data to prepare it for analysis.
* Tableau: Used for creating dynamic and interactive visualizations to effectively present and analyze the data relationships.

### Motivation
The rising prevalence of screen time and its correlation with sedentary lifestyles in children initiated this project. It seeks effective interventions that could promote physical activity, using AVGs as a potential motivator due to their interactive and engaging nature.

### Why Build This Project?
This project was developed to address the critical issue of increasing sedentary behavior among children, with significant public health implications. By integrating autonomy into the choice of AVGs, it assesses whether this approach can lead to a meaningful increase in physical activity, informing future health interventions and policies.

### Key Learnings
* Data Pre-Processing: Handling and integrating complex datasets from diverse sources was essential for accurate analysis.
* Creating Dashboard: Demonstrated how effective visual representations, created through Tableau, help in interpreting complex data and communicating findings clearly.
